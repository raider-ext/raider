## Peeking through the ``window``: Fingerprinting Browser Extensions through Page-Visible Execution Traces and Interactions

Here, we provide with the test pages that we used for _Raider_ to detect fingerprintable extensions.
 - API hooks & Execution Traces from Injected Scripts - https://raider-ext.github.io/raider/pages/honey/raider-hooks.html
 - Polling page used to collect data form client-side data stores and intercept _postMessages_ - https://raider-ext.github.io/raider/pages/honey/raider-poll.html

 Additionally, we also provide the reviewers with the test page used by Karami et al. [25] for comparison purposes - https://raider-ext.github.io/raider/pages/honey/carnus.html.
