## Peeking through the ``window``: Fingerprinting Browser Extensions through Page-Visible Execution Traces and Interactions

Please find the list of extensions that our tool, _Raider_, reported to be fingerprintable for different extension datasets in our study and associated details in the ``fingerprintable_extensions`` directory.

The ``hooks.json`` file contains the list of Global JavaScript APIs and properties we instrumented for this study to capture any extension-induced traces at runtime.

Please find the __Proof-of-Concepts__ extensions with their uniquely identifying vectors [here](./proof-of-concept).
