## Peeking through the ``window``: Fingerprinting Browser Extensions through Page-Visible Execution Traces and Interactions

Please find the list of extensions that our tool, _Raider_, reported to be fingerprintable for different extension datasets in our study and associated details in the ``fingerprintable_extensions`` directory.

<!-- We will soon update the repository with the __Proof-of-Concepts__ for extension developers based on different fingerprinting vectors that we studied. -->

Please find the __Proof-of-Concepts__ extensions with their uniquely identifying vectors [here](./proof-of-concept).
